Demo repo to show how we can organize tests for micro services.
The basic idea is for each micro-service we create a dedicated folder for the tests.

In this example repo, we have below items
- demo  this is a demo micro-service
- demo-test  this is where we put cases for demo service

this is a test repo
this is added in a feature branch
another change again
